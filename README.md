# Privacy preserving facial recognition

This project was conducted as part of my master's thesis ["Privacy preservation aspects of image modification in facial recognition"](./thesis.pdf) at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## Problem Statement
The goal was to develop a facial recognition system that does not rely on original face embeddings. Instead, we propose modifying the images before feature extraction and retaining their vector representations. The ideal modification should enable the system to perform effectively with similarly modified images while failing to recognize original, unmodified images. In the event of data leakage, embeddings from such a system would provide significantly less information about the users compared to original embeddings. Developing such a system represents a crucial step towards creating better privacy-preserving facial recognition technologies.

## Results
The detailed results can be found in the file [thesis](./thesis.pdf). In short, we demonstrate that it is possible to use the [LowKey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07922) modification to create a system with a modified image database that performs well against images with the same modification (74\% accuracy) but significantly worse with unmodified images (25\% accuracy). We believe this approach can serve as a cornerstone for developing even better techniques focusing primarily on our goal.
Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our dataset and concluded that the tested modifications introduce some disturbance in the embedding space, warranting further examination. 
By integrating these findings, our work lays the groundwork for advancing the development of facial recognition systems that prioritize privacy.
